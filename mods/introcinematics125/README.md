# Intro Cinematics

The Intro Cinematics mod tries to improve the cinematics experience of Payday 2.
It adds over 65 hand made cinematics to the start of each heist, replacing the normally dull black screen.
Each animation uniquely made for that heist, showing the action moving along with the audio.
All these heist also support Crime Spree, showing your current progress!

This mod has been built with modability in mind.
Any map maker can easily add their own simple animation using the provided XML workflow.
Or if you would like something more fancy, cinematics can also be added programmatically. Allowing for ever more custom animations, models, lighting, etc.
